\section{Classic strategies written using the described grammar}
A desired property of the grammar used in grammatical evolution is that it's able to generate all classic heuristic solutions, while also being able to generate some new solutions. In this subchapter, we will go through the classic stragies, which were explained in the subchapter 3.1.2., and show how they can be written using the grammar described in the subchapter 3.2.

\subsection{FIFO (First In First Out)}

The FIFO strategy can be written like:

\noindent
\begin{algorithmic}
%\State $i \gets 10$
%\If{$i\geq 5$} 
%    \State $i \gets i-1$
%\Else
%    \If{$i\leq 3$}
%        \State $i \gets i+2$
%    \EndIf
%\EndIf 
\State $frame = added\_to\_cache\_min();$
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{CLOCK}

The CLOCK strategy can be written like:

\noindent
\begin{algorithmic}
\State $ iterations = 0;$
\State $ while\:(get\_accessed(num1)\:==\:1\:\&\& \:iterations \:<\:frame\_count)\:\{$
\State $ \indent set\_accessed(num1, 0);$
\State $ \indent num1 = num1 + 1;$
\State $ \indent if\:(num1 >= frame\_count)\:\{$
\State $ \indent\indent num1 = 0;$
\State $ \}$
\State $frame = num1;$
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{LRU (Least Recently Used)}

The LRU strategy can be written like:

\noindent
\begin{algorithmic}
\State $frame = last\_accessed\_min();$
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{LFU (Least Frequently Used)}

The LFU strategy can be written like:

\noindent
\begin{algorithmic}
\State $frame = page\_access\_count\_min();$
\end{algorithmic}
